# TSO Translation Project
Welcome to the TSO Translation Project maintained by [Afr0](https://github.com/Afr0) and the Project Dollhouse team. To contribute, make sure you have The Sims Online installed, then download [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com), finally fork [this](https://github.com/Afr0Games/the-sims-online-translation) repository.

You can find the files to translate in **Maxis\The Sims Online\TSOClient\gamedata\uitext\english.dir\.** Make sure to look and see at the languages already provided by this project before starting your own. Once you've finished translating or fixing present translations, you can send us a [pull request](http://forum.afr0games.com/index.php?threads/fork-pull-github-for-newbies.418/).

## Special Characters
For languages with special characters such as æ, ø, å, or ä **please make sure to save all your files as UTF-8, not ANSI,** or they will break the client!
